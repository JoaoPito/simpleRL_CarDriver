# simpleRL_CarDriver
A simple Reinforcement Learning Neural Net project made in unity. 
The goal is for the cars to learn how to drive in a highway, it will have to coordenate the acceleration and direction, as well as distances from other lanes, other cars and speed limits, the inputs are the simplest as possible.
